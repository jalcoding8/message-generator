## General Information
   *  This repository was created as a project to use JavaScript and markdown
      to build a program to generate a random message to user.
      My program is a MEAL PLAN generator that makes suggestions for a dinner menu
      with a beverage, entree, and a side dish.
   *  There are two files: a script.js and a READEME.md
